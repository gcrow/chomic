[{"content":"About\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;this site This site serves as a place to document my thoughts and ramblings. The main subject areas it probably covers are:\nInformation security - Blu-ish cybersecurity; architecture, cloud, product, management, strategy and delivery Neurodiversity - Thinking on the neurodivergent paradigm (c.f. Robert Chapman) as well as real-life trials and tribulations observed and experienced Sociotechnical humanity - Emergent behaviour is tricky stuff, in both organisations and society Corgis - The reason you are here, I know There will be overlap!\n\u0026hellip;me My name is Gabe Chomic. I\u0026rsquo;m a multiply neurodivergent technologist, tinkerer and polymath with a great interest in both people and cybersecurity. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked in technology for over two decades and across 14 countries, mostly in security but with sojourns into audit and operations. Having worn that hats of CTO, senior manager w/offshore, and individual contributor I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a frightening degree of error and some successes over the years. I currently focus on cloud security architecture at scale.\nSecurity follows me out of the office too. I\u0026rsquo;m a big proponent of the infosec community. I served as President of the Information Security Systems Association\u0026rsquo;s UK chapter for six years, have moonlit at DC4420, help keep things running at 44CON and try to contribute when I can to BSides London. I\u0026rsquo;ve spoken frequently over the past decades but rarely on record - my most recent was in 2021.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been a neurodiversity and disability advocate since 2019, within my employer(s) and to a very small extent online. Among other things, I am proudly autistic (despite masking far too effectively), ADHD-I and dyspraxic. This made growing up on the northern edge of mileniallihood very interesting, and I coped by developing a hyperfocus on people - on social dynamics and how they worked.\nWhich, is what led me from an engineering undergrad to a social science masters, a great many flight miles and eventually settling on the other side of the ocean from whence I was born. This is a personal weblog. The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about\"\u003eAbout\u0026hellip;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"this-site\"\u003e\u0026hellip;this site\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis site serves as a place to document my thoughts and ramblings.
